    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I live for freedom, style, and the thrill of standing out. This page is a tribute to bold energy and fierce vibes.</p>

    Legend has it, they were born under a disco ball during a thunderstorm—equal parts chaos and charisma. Known to some as a visionary, to others as “that person who wore sequins to jury duty,” they’ve spent their life defying norms, dodging responsibilities, and perfecting the art of dramatic entrances. Their hobbies include posing near wind machines, misquoting philosophers, and curating playlists that could start revolutions.

    They didn’t choose the spotlight—it chose them, mostly because they refused to leave. This site is a shrine to their aesthetic: bold, bizarre, and just self-aware enough to be dangerous. If you’re here for subtlety, you’ve taken a wrong turn. But if you crave flair, freedom, and the occasional eagle fly-by, welcome home.
