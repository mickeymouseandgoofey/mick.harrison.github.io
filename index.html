  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>I live for freedom, style, and the thrill of standing out.</p>
  <p>This page is a tribute to bold energy and fierce vibes.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Legend has it, he was born under a disco ball during a thunderstorm.</p>
  <p>Equal parts chaos and charisma.</p>
  <p>Known to some as a visionary, to others simply as ”Florida Man".</p>
  <p>He's spent his life dodging norms, responsibilities, and dress codes.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Hobbies include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Posing near wind machines</li>
    <li>Misquoting philosophers</li>
    <li>Curating playlists that could start revolutions</li>
  </ul>

  <br>

  <p>He didn’t choose the spotlight—it chooses him.</p>
  <p>Mostly because he refused to leave.</p>
  <p>This site is a shrine to his aesthetic: bold, bizarre, and just self-aware enough to be dangerous.</p>
  <p>If you’re here for subtlety, you’ve taken a wrong turn.</p>
  <p>If you crave flair, freedom, and the occasional eagle fly-by—welcome home.</p>
